# Wordle Clone - JavaScript Logic Demonstration

A fully functional clone of the popular word-guessing game, **Wordle**. This project was built as part of my deep-dive into **Vanilla JavaScript** and **DOM Manipulation**, following a structured tutorial to understand complex game state management.

## 🚀 Key Learning Outcomes & Skills
By building this project, I have solidified my understanding of:
* **Complex Game Logic:** Implementing rules for checking correct, present, and absent letters using color-coded feedback.
* **State Management:** Tracking current attempts, active rows, and game-over conditions in real-time.
* **DOM Manipulation:** Dynamically updating the grid and virtual keyboard based on user input (both physical and on-screen).
* **Event Handling:** Efficiently managing keyboard events and click listeners to provide a seamless user experience.
* **CSS Grid & Animations:** Designing a responsive 5x6 grid and implementing "flip" and "shake" animations for interactive feedback.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **HTML5:** Semantic structure for the game board and virtual keyboard.
* **CSS3:** Custom layouts using Flexbox/Grid and keyframe animations.
* **Vanilla JavaScript:** Core engine for game mechanics and validation.

## 📝 Inspiration & Credits
This project was built following the excellent tutorial by **[Web Dev Simplified]** on YouTube ([Watch here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wak7iN4JZzU)). 

**Why I chose this project:**
I wanted to challenge myself with a project that requires more than just static data rendering. Wordle is a perfect example of how to manage multiple states and complex conditional logic in JavaScript, which is a fundamental skill for any software developer.
